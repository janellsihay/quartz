The distribution of Chl in the ocean surface is strongly linked with physical ocean processes as these affect the distribution of light and nutrients, the main factors in primary production. Based on the visual pattern, this enhancement is often associated with [island wakes](notes/island-wakes.md), a physical phenomenon where and incoming flow is modified by a bluff body - in this case an ocean current interacting with the island. \n\n**Keywords**: physical oceanography, satellite ocean data, chlorophyll-a, ocean data analysis, Bohol Sea\n\nMain references:","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T01:13:51.863532745Z","tags":[]},"/notes/zines":{"title":"zines","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T01:13:51.863532745Z","tags":[]}}
